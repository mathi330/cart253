# Template p5 project

This is the README file for the entire project. For more official projects you should write information here about the nature of the project, your name, any special explanations of how the project works, etc.

What I want to do:
Some kind of game where the goal is to use "material" to protect something (not sure what yet) from "enemies."
If the thing that is being protected is touched by anything, "material" or "enemies," it dies.
"enemies" disappear when they touch "material" and "material" looses some "durability" (represented by the opacity).
