# Prototype

Mathilde Davan

This is a prototype for a bigger project. Here I concentrated more on the aesthetic and learning how to create weird looking shapes. This prototype does not contain any interactive elements and is more of a visual experience.

The viewer can also see the experimentations I made prior to making the prototype. (the code for those is atrocious but it was to get a hang of how things worked)
