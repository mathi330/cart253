# Thought Landscape

Mathilde Davan

Thought Landscape is a piece exploring interactivity and exploring the predetermined meaning of things such as keys from a keyboard. In this work, I wanted to challenge the use of certain keys in certain situations by changing what they meant in the context of this work. This program has a total of 13 changes. Each change can be triggered by pressing on a specific key of the keyboard. When choosing which key would trigger which change, I thought of the original meaning/use of the key to change it. The keys I chose are:

1- Z (for ctrl z) = change the thickness of one thing
2- Y (for ctrl y)= change the color of one thing
3- C (for ctrl c)= big shape sound
4- V (for ctrl v)= small shape sound
5- X (for ctrl x)= line sound
6- A (for ctrl a)= delete shape
7- backspace = create new big shape
8- enter = create new small shape
9- shift = lightning
10- up arrow = change background color
11- down arrow = change everything's color
12- left arrow = change everything's thickness
13- right arrow = change everything's distortion range

For example, when I was choosing the key for the change, I thought ctrl c, v, and x work together (copy, paste, cut) so the chosen changes will need something in common; for me, shift is not something that writes anything down but something that is used as a "passing thing" and therefore, the lightning was perfect...

Because I also wanted to confuse the viewers and make them dabble with the keyboard without really knowing the meaning of each key, I don't have any instructions. Also, I think it is important to have each key create a reaction, for that reason, every key other than the predetermined keys will choose a random change out of the following 6 (which were taken from the 13 above):

- change the thickness of one thing,
- change the color of one thing,
- lightning,
- change background color,
- change everything's color,
- change everything's thickness.

As for the visual and audio aspect of the piece, I wanted to create something abstract, relaxing, changing while still staying the same. To me, the lines represent the waves of sea or mountains as you pass by them in a car, a train,... The shapes moving can by the clouds, birds, trees,... And the sound is the wind, the sea,...
But the It can also be a non geographic landscape. The lines can also be the trail of my thoughts in constant motion, and the shapes can be ideas.
Because it is an abstract piece, it can really represent anything the viewer sees or imagine. It can represent something specific or simply be a relaxing image or anything really.
