# Make Some Noise

Mathilde Davan

In this exercise, I experiment with sound and the oscillator. This project pairs sound with the movements of circles on a canvas. Each circle has a sound with a frequency that changes depending on the x position of the circle and an amplitude that varies with the y position. The viewer can interact with the piece by adding circles, and therefore sounds, by clicking with their mouse. They can also mute and unmute the sound by clicking on the spacebar and delete a circle by clicking on the backspace key of their keyboard (stopping the sound of that circle at the same time).
The circles visual also changes with audio input. If the viewer makes a loud sound, the circles will get bigger and turn more red/pink.
