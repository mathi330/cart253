# I like to move it!

This project is an abstract piece composed of a moving triangle in the center changing color with a square of the same color in the background rotating. On top of the triangle, we can see 4 empty squares and 4 empty circles moving across the canvas each in its own direction.
I also made my background slightly transparent to make the movements of the empty shapes more mesmerizing and fluid in my opinion.
The mouse's movements were integrated with the size of the empty squares and the customized mouse cursor that I made and that reminds the movements and shapes of the bigger empty shapes.
