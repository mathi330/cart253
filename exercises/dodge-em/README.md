# Dodge 'em! (or not?)

By Mathilde Davan

In this project, the user moves the emoji with the mouse and can either try to avoid the moving circles/enemies or instead make them collide to change the emoji shown and the color of the background (which alternates between a dark grey and a random color).
When they reach the sleepy and they collide with a circle, the screen goes black with "GO SLEEP!!" written on it.
The user can reset the "game" by clicking with their mouse on the canvas and it will go back to the smiling emoji (the first in the order).
