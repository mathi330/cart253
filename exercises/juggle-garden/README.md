# Juggle Garden

Mathilde Davan

This project is about emotional well-being where different emotions are represented by colored circles.
Each emotions interacts differently with the paddle controlled by the player with the left and right arrow keys.
Happiness (yellow) will make the paddle a little bigger, anger (red) a little smaller, sadness (blue) much smaller, and love (pink) won't change it.
The game has 2 possible endings. One is a bad ending if the paddle disappears completely, and the good ending can happen in 2 ways.
Either if the paddle got to its maximum size (half the width of the canvas) or if the player was able to make the love get to its maximum size.
However, love only appears once at the beginning of the game, so once it fell, the player cannot win through this way.
