# Love, Actually

Mathilde Davan
This project is a simulation/game about love where the user can move the "me" element (circle in the middle of the canvas at the start) with the arrow keys on their keyboard.
When the user collides with a heart, the heart will turn white, but at the same time, some hearts will turn black as they collide with some other hearts.
The simulation ends when all hearts are either black or white, and depending on the number of white hearts, a quote will appear.

The heart images and quotes were not mine, here are where I found them.
